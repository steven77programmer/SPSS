<<<STUDENT PROBLEM SOLVER SYSTEM>>>

Problem Solver software is a software oriented for college students benefits, it is students-college interface where students communicate their problems through this software. A community interface for informing or complaining their problems and issue. Here students can vote and upload issue they are facing. The issue which is faced by most gets voted and by the students themselves. The most voted post (complain or issue) is visible to the handler who represent the college management. The interface is very handy for students as their identity is anonymous to any other student or handler.
